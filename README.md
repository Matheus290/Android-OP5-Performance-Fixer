# Android OP5 Performance Fixer
This module fixes performance issues with some games, emulators (mainly AetherSX2/[NetherSX2](https://github.com/Trixarian/NetherSX2-patch)) and video playback on Android on Orange Pi 5, caused by multi-audio, replacing the "audio_policy_configuration.xml" file with the file fixed by Hezzym.
